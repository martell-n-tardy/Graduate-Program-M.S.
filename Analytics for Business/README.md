# Project Overview #
## Background ##
Valve Corporation is an American video game developer, publisher and digital distributor.  After releasing the video game DOTA 2 in 2013 the company took a five-year hiatus from the production of video games to focus on understanding what motivates players to engage with games, compete in tournaments, and ultimately provide the best user experience.  With Valve Corporationâ€™s unique composition of being a digital content distribution channel, in the form of the platform Steam, a sponsor of one the biggest international esports tournaments titled, The International, a producer of consumer electronic devices, such as the Steam Controller, and their prior successful video game development, with Counter-Strike and Dota 2 - Gabe Newell (valve Co-founder) is confident that there is no better time than now for Valve Corporation to produce the next big video game to complete their domination of the video game industry.

## Problem Statement ##
* **(Business)** Can Valve Corporation release again a profitable and popular video game in their 2018 production? 
* **(Analytical)** Can the use of historical data identify the key features of past profitable video games and predict the characteristics of a similar deliverable for the Valve Corporation to release in the last quarter of 2018?

## Methodology ##
To solve this business problem Valve Corporation must release a game reflecting the key features of prior released video games that have already received profitable returns, have a strong online community following, positive user and critic ratings, and strong retention rates at tournaments. To address this task four objectives that center around variable observations assumed to effect maximized sales, user interaction, ratings, and tournament retention historically were explored.
